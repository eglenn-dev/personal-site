# Welcome to MarkNote.one!

_2025-01-28_

I am please to announce the launch of MarkNote.one!

### Background

As a developer I love taking notes in markdown because of the simplicity of formatting right from the keyboard. I decided to make MarkNote.one only 2.5 weeks ago. It is still under development and I am open to any and all feedback.

### Tech Used

It supports login in with GitHub, and live previews of your notes in markdown. I designed the project to be hosted in a serverless hosting environment for easy deployment.

It was made in React with Next.js and TypeScript and Firebase for the database.
