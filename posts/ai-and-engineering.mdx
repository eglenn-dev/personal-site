# AI and Engineering

_2026-02-13_

I've been talking a lot recently with my co-workers about how AI is going to change software engineering. For a while I started wondering if getting my degree in computer science was worth it. I've come to realize that there is a lot that AI cannot do.

## Building the right product vs. building the product right

I was listening to a clip from a product manager at Instagram. He raised this question of building the _right_ product, vs. building the product _right_.

With AI enabled engineering I think we've all seen an efficiency increase. Software engineers who know what they are doing -- mainly because they could build the same product/feature without AI -- are becoming vastly more efficient because they are able to articulate the solution to an AI agent in a way that allows quick execution from the model.

So if building the product _right_ is easier than ever before, where does this leave us? Building the right product is now the main question. Code is becoming a commodity. The barrier for building custom software is lower than ever before. This is an amazing accomplishment and represents 183 years of [refinement](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2021662676817195500?s=20) from some of the best minds in our time.

My dad, a portfolio manager, pointed out that his industry went through this same shift years ago. For him anyone is able to make an account on Robinhood and start investing. He works to bring more value than just a platform to invest. Where code is now a commodity, engineers need to being more value than just means to write code.

This means that we now need to be better at building the right product, and offering services that are more than just another product to be [recreated](https://www.vox.com/politics/478794/ai-economy-claude-code-jobs-openai-anthropic#:~:text=Why%20agentic%20AI%20is%20a%20game%2Dchanger) with a prompt.

This leaves us asking, where engineers belong in a world where code is cheap?

## Code is cheap, but solutions aren't

I think we'll see a shift from "Software Engineering" to "Solution Engineering". There is still going to be a need, at least in the near future, for programmers that understand the systems and principles of security and proper engineering. AI is good, but the [security problems](https://www.wiz.io/blog/exposed-moltbook-database-reveals-millions-of-api-keys#:~:text=post%20in%20Moltbook.-,How%20the%20Moltbook%20Database%20Was%20Exposed,-Discovery%20of%20Exposed) it makes are ones that I made when starting out programming.

I always see tutorials online for "Build Your Own X (Twitter)." If you think about it, the key foundations of X are just CRUD operations on a database. You make posts, share, like, and chat about them. This is very easily recreated locally. Those doing this will quickly run into the problem of engineering infrastructure, if they can jump the massive hurdle of getting users. The fact is X -- like every other social media platform -- is more than just a way to upload and post text or media. The question of doing that for 500+ million monthly active users is a completely different question than simply creating a platform all that can be done on.

My work consulting for DataThink has been a great exposure to this. Our engineering team does way more than just commit diffs. A large part of our time is spent problem solving. We get direction from executives and often they ask for a solution to a ill defined problem. It is what they think they need, rather than addressing the actual business problem (more on the [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)). We talk through the engineering implications of what they need.

Only after we have defined the problem, and also identified the solution are we able to use AI to build it.

## Is my degree worth it?

Yes. I enjoyed my degree and got a lot out of it.
