# Senior Project Update: An AI-Powered Resume Assistant

_2025-05-05_

I'm excited to share an update on my senior project: **developing an AI-powered resume builder**.
The motivation behind this project stems from the challenges many qualified candidates face in today's job market. It's increasingly difficult to get noticed, partly due to factors like the **high volume of applications** and even the misuse of **AI to create fake applications** ([read this](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-job-seekers-flooding-market-artificial-intelligence/)).

My goal is to create a tool that allows **genuine job seekers to leverage AI** ethically and effectively, enhancing their visibility without misrepresenting their qualifications. Hereâ€™s the planned workflow:

1. **User Data Input**: Users can input their work history, skills, and education manually, or import data from an existing resume or LinkedIn profile.

2. **Job Description Analysis**: By providing a URL to a specific job posting, the tool will scrape and analyze the page to extract key requirements and relevant keywords.

3. **AI-Powered Tailoring**: The AI will generate a resume draft specifically tailored to the target job description. Importantly, this focuses on highlighting the user's actual experience and skills using relevant keywords, also ensuring it will not fabricate information. The aim is to help authentic applications pass initial screening filters.

4. **Review & Customization**: Users can review and refine the AI-generated content, choose a preferred professional template, and download the final resume as a PDF for easy application submission.

While this project focuses on practical application rather than groundbreaking AI research, I believe it can offer valuable assistance, helping individuals effectively showcase their qualifications and **use AI to their advantage** in this evolving job market.

Below is an image of a resume it generated for me **this morning**. I look forward to sharing more as it progresses!
