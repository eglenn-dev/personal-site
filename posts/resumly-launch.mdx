# Introducing Resumly.pro: AI for Crafting Job-Winning Resumes

_2025-06-09_

**TL;DR:** After months of hard work, I'm incredibly excited to introduce [Resumly.pro](https://resumly.pro), a free resume builder that [tailors your resume](#how-does-it-work?) to job postings. It uses AI to analyze job descriptions and generate resumes that will stand out to employers. It's [built](#how-did-i-make-it?) with Python, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. Try it out at [resumly.pro](https://resumly.pro)!

See my last post about how I implemented [web scraping](/blog/implementing-web-scraping).

## Why Resumly.pro?

I started Resumly.pro to help people create better resumes. I've seen countless talented individuals struggle to articulate their value on paper, sending resumes into the 'black hole' of online applications. The job market isn't just competitive; it's now navigating a [flood of AI-generated applications](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-job-seekers-flooding-market-artificial-intelligence/), making it even harder for genuine candidates to break through. I realized that if AI is part of the problem, it can also be a powerful part of the solution, for real people.

## How does it work?

Resumly.pro simplifies the often daunting task of resume tailoring. Our goal is to get you from job description to application-ready resume in minutes, for free. Hereâ€™s the magic:

1. **Provide Your Information:** You start by uploading a previous resume or filling out a form with your details. You only need to do this once and keep it updated, and Resumly.pro worries about storing the information.
2. **Provide a Job Posting URL:** You paste a link to a job posting that you want to apply for. Resumly.pro will analyze the job description and extract the key requirements.
3. **Generate a Tailored Resume:** Based on the job description, Resumly.pro will generate a tailored resume that highlights your skills and experiences relevant to the job. It will focus on keywords and phrases that are important for the position, ensuring that your resume stands out to both ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and human recruiters. You can also make changes to the generated resume if needed.
4. **Download and Apply:** You can download your tailored resume in PDF format and use it to apply for the job.

## How did I make it?

Resumly.pro is a platform I developed leveraging a modern technology stack including Python, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB Atlas. Its robust backend, powered by Flask, efficiently handles resume generation and job description analysis. The user-friendly frontend is built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and contemporary design. Deployment is optimized across Render (Flask backend) and Vercel (Next.js frontend), with data managed on MongoDB Atlas.

This robust setup means Resumly.pro is fast, reliable, and can grow with our users, ensuring a smooth experience even during peak job hunting seasons. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eglenn-dev/resumly)
