> Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, Git Rewind is a web application that provides users with a summary of their GitHub activity over the past year, including contributions, repositories, and more. It allows users to visualize their coding journey and share it with others.

Building Git Rewind was a fun project that allowed me to explore the GitHub API and GraphQL, which I had never used before. The project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and it leverages the GitHub API to fetch user data and contributions.

## Data Fetching

Data is fetched on the server from a server component. The GitHub API is called using a GraphQL query to retrieve the user's contributions and repository information. The data is then processed and passed to the client for rendering.

One of my main reasons for starting this project was to learn more about GraphQL and how to use it effectively. I found it to be a powerful tool for querying data, and it made the process of fetching and manipulating data much more efficient. I also wanted a way to see cool stats about my GitHub activity.

## Features

This is a very simple project, and only took me a hand full of hours to build over the course of a weekend. The main features include:

- The users total contributions for the year.
- The users most active day of the week for commits.
- The users most active month of the year for commits.
- The users longest daily commit streak for the year.
- The users most used languages by repository.
- The time of day the user is most active for commits.
- Finally, a GitHub inspired commit heat map for the year.

### Other Additions

- A short guide on how to make private contributions public, without making the repositories public.
- A share button for sharing the link to the user's Git Rewind summary.
- Getting the users profile picture from GitHub to make the summary more visually appealing.
